Hey, Documentation should be fun to read. You're welcome!

# DESING PATTERNS - Common in Object Orineted Program Design | Node.js

This Repositorys' main aim is to illustrate the variety of common Design Patterns used in Object Oriented Design; in this context Node.js was used (No frameworks).
Get started simply, by running `node index.js` the code in the terminal pointing to the directories [1. Without Pattern]() and [2. With Pattern](), to see the difference via console outputs of when the a design pattern has not been used and when it has been used.

## Overview

Each Pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

Design Pattern Essentials:

- Pattern name
- The Problem
- The Solution
- Consequences

### Example: Code Navigation to singleton pattern.

1. Navigate to [1. Creational Patterns](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/)/[1. Singleton Pattern](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/)/[1. Without Pattern](./1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/1.%20Without%20Pattern/)/[index.js](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/1.%20Without%20Pattern/index.js).
2. Read through the code files in the folder of [1. Without Pattern](./1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/1.%20Without%20Pattern/); when familiar with the code, get to the terminal pointing to the directory and run `node index.js`. See the console output.
3. Now navigate to [1. Creational Patterns](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/)/[1. Singleton Pattern](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/)/[1. With Pattern](./1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/1.%20Witht%20Pattern/)/[index.js](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/1.%20Without%20Pattern/index.js).
4. Read through the code and get familiar with the pattern used.Open the terminal now pointing to the current index.js directory and run `node index.js`. see the console output.
5. Repeat this procedure for each of the following Design patterns:

#### Creational Patterns

- [Singleton Pattern](./1.%20Creational%20Patterns/1.%20Singleton%20Pattern/)
- [Prototype Pattern](./1.%20Creational%20Patterns/2.%20Prototype%20Pattern/)
- [Factory Pattern](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/3.%20Factory%20Pattern/)
- [Builder Pattern](1.%20Creational%20Patterns/4.%20Builder%20Pattern/)

#### Structural Pattern

#### Behavioral Pattern

## Code Context

To start let's agree this; Learning node.js or any programming language is just a subtle thing of being a developer; Great node.js masterminds must use some kind of Design Pattern to solve code problems. Well, this Documentation (and Repository), gets you familiar with the code and the design patterns used in the code. The code examples reflect real world senario of an e-commerce enterprise, where you might at some point, have an employer, employee, shopper, distributer and more. We reflect on the concept of a store and make code solutions to solve various issues that may rise while making a virtual store in node.js.
